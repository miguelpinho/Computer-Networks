# Computer-Networks
Laboratories and project for the Computer Networks course.

## Project
Client-server application, where the available servers are organized in a ring and cooperate to provide a service.

The requests from the clients are made to a gateway server already provided by the course lecturers, where the service ring must register.

Ring protocols are implemented to allow new servers to enter or to exit, to determine whether there is availability for new clients and to choose the next server to accept a client.
